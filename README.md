# hello-world
Just another repository

Although I am new to coding I have jumped in with both feet. I initially bought an arduino to learn C++. and it is coming along quite well. Also, I have created an account with Codecademy.com and I ahve been spending an hour or so in the evening going through basic HTML, and command line script. I had never heard of Github.com until just the other day while watching a Youtube video about a CNC project and the person said they got help on Github, so I figured it would definately be worth checking out. I am now realizing how importaint this tool can be. Sometimes I am working on a script for an Arduino project, and soon to be Raspberry Pi, and I get stuck on a bug that I don't understand and I get bumbed because of a lack of resources, however it seems this is about to change!
Remember tools like GitHub are what make open source software so 'open'.
